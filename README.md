## What is this Project About??


It's a weather app based on open weather map api, that lets you know the weather anywhere by filling the form, by typing city name & country name (you should type the correct names!).


## Why did you create this application??


Everybody should be concerned about the weather, knowing weather is important for making decesions like traveling, working or visiting someone.

But in fact I have a personal motive, which is to learn and apply front end web developement by creating a responsive react app that fetchs data from open weather api and create an awesome UI to present it.


## What did you learn from creating this application??


I have learnt many things, first of all i used styled-components in styling the application, by dividing the application into small components and styling each of them separately i faced many bugs and fixed alot of them. Secondly i used the promise to fetch data from the api for the first time, i didn't succeed from the first time but i made it work. And lastly the most challenging part was adding the visual which represnt the weather description which I added later from a working github project using javascript
